This project is centered around creating an advanced water level monitoring system that
integrates an ESP32 microcontroller, water level sensor, and a buzzer, with the added
functionality of remote data monitoring through the ThingSpeak platform. The primary goal
of this system is to monitor and control water levels in a tank efficiently, offering real-time
updates and alerts. The system reads data from the water level sensor, which is scaled to a 0-
100 range to represent the current water level. This data is then transmitted wirelessly via WiFi to ThingSpeak, where users can view it remotely on a user-friendly web interface. To
prevent overflow, a buzzer is activated when the water level reaches a preset threshold,
providing an audible warning for immediate action. This project addresses the critical issue of
water wastage and overflow by providing timely alerts, enabling users to act before any
overflow occurs. It is highly beneficial in applications such as agricultural irrigation systems,
where monitoring water levels efficiently can help conserve water and optimize usage, as
well as residential water tanks, where overflow can cause damage. Furthermore, industrial
water storage systems benefit from such a solution by minimizing the risks of flooding and
loss of resources. The system is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and easy to
implement, using the power of IoT technology to make water management more efficient.
With the ability to remotely monitor water levels in real-time, users can take action from
anywhere, ensuring that resources are not wasted, and systems operate efficiently. This IoTbased water monitoring solution thus enhances sustainability, offering a modern approach to
managing and conserving water in various sectors
